📰 Fake News Detection Using Machine Learning
This project implements a fake news detection system using several machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify news as either real (true) or fake.

📁 Dataset
True.csv: Contains real news articles.

Fake.csv: Contains fake news articles.

Each dataset includes:

title: Title of the article

text: Body/content of the article

subject: Topic category

date: Date of publication

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Concatenated both datasets and added a binary label:

1 for True News

0 for Fake News

Dropped unnecessary columns: title, subject, date

Cleaned text using regular expressions:

Converted to lowercase

Removed URLs, HTML tags, punctuation, numbers, and newline characters

📊 Feature Extraction
Used TF-IDF Vectorizer from sklearn to convert textual data into numerical form for model training.
